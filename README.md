# Personal Portfolio Project: SMS Notification Service

This is a non-commercial project being built for my personal developer portfolio to learn the Twilio API.

### Goal
To learn how to integrate a third-party API and build a simple web application that can send SMS notifications.

### Use Case
The system is for educational and testing purposes only. It will be used to send test alerts (like one-time passcodes or status updates) to my own phone number and a few friends who agree to help me test.

### Technology
* Python
* Flask
* Twilio API
